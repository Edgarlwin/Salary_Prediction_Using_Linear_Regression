# Salary Prediction Using Linear Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a simple linear regression model to predict salaries based on years of experience.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between years of experience and salary using a linear regression model. This model aims to predict an individual's salary based on their years of professional experience.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of two columns:
- `Years of Experience`: The number of years the individual has been working.
- `Salary`: The annual salary of the individual.

## Contents

- `simple_linear_regression.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook that includes the entire analysis, from data visualization to the implementation of the linear regression model.
- `data/`: A folder containing the dataset (if applicable).
- `README.md`: This file.

## Dependencies

To run the notebook, you will need the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
